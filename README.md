##LicensePlateAvailabilityChecker

Check and see if a custom license plate is available in your state, in the works by Montana Mendy. Written in Ruby on Rails.

##The idea 

The idea is so you don't have to go to each ".gov" website, so it's essentially a one "stop shop" to check to see if a custom plate you want is taken or not, for example as of now, if you want to check a plate in CA, you'd have to go to the DMV site specifically for CA, if you wanted info on a custom plate in Florida, you'd have to go to the Florida's version, and check there.
